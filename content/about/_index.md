👋 Hi, I’m **Prithvi Poreddy** — a Product Leader specializing in **Identity Security, IAM, and AI-driven Governance**.

Currently, I work at the intersection of **Identity, Risk, and Intelligent Automation**, helping enterprises build secure and scalable identity foundations.

---

### Focus Areas
- Identity Security (IAM, IGA, PAM)
- Non Human Identity & Agentic AI Governance
- Trust and Safety
- Product Strategy & Technical Architecture

---

### Background
I've led IAM initiatives at organizations like **Meta (Facebook)**, **Lime**, **Deloitte**, and **World Bank**, building scalable access models and advising C-suite teams on identity modernization.

When I’m not deep in security design, you’ll find me playing pickleball, writing long-form tech pieces, or playing tabletop boardgames.

---

### Current Focus
My current focus is **AI-driven identity governance**, designing frameworks for **autonomous agent identities**, and aligning human + machine access models.

I believe the next era of IAM will merge **posture management**, **visibility intelligence**, and **adaptive access** built on transparent, explainable AI systems.
